## 🔗 Path Aliases

This project uses path aliases to simplify imports and avoid relative path issues. The `@/` alias is configured to point to the `src/` directory:

- `@/*` → `src/*`

**Examples:**
- `@/components/Board/Board` → `src/components/Board/Board`
- `@/types` → `src/types`
- `@/constants` → `src/constants`
- `@/utilities` → `src/utilities`

This makes imports cleaner and more maintainable, eliminating the need for complex relative paths like `../../types`.
